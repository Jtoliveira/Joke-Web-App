# Joke-Web-App
Small project using node.js, MongoDB and the JokeAPI. 

I also used other modules to add a small layer of security, like Passport.js and node.bcrypt.js. 

Frontend developed with EJS.

The code itself has some flaws, like the lack of delete and put methods on the user routes, a server.js file with messy code and the IDs passed as a request parameters between views so it can be accessed by the routers.

## Running the thing:

1) make sure mongoDB is up and running and Node.js is installed on the computer
2) open a terminal in the project folder
3) "npm install"
4) "npm run devStart"
